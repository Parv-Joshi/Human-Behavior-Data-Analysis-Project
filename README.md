# Human Behavior Data Analysis Project

This was an individual project done for a course requirement of AMS 315: Data Analysis.
This project was spilt into two parts -- project 1 and project 2. Project 1 was sub-divided into parts A and B.
You can find the R code to Project 1 Part A, Project 1 Part B, and Project 2. 

Datasets used for Project 1 Part A are P1A_DV69570.csv and P1A_IV69570.csv. 
For Project 1 Part B, the dataset was P1B69570.csv.
FOr Project 2, the dataset was P2_69570.csv.
All these datasets were synthetically made by our professor.
The data is actually a a replica of a real Human Behavior Data Analysis Project done by Caspi et al. (Link to actual research: https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1083968)

Here are the research questions for each part:
(1A) Single variable linear regression model development
(1B) Finding the best regression model using various transformations of IV, DV, or both.
(2) Finding the best transformed model of the dependent variable Y on 4 environmental variables (E1–E4) and 20 genetic variables (G1–G20) using stepwise regression.
